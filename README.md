## PoliticApp

This project covers the development of a mobile application that allows users to quickly and easily find open information about
the Congress of Deputies and their political representatives, as well as providing a channel to express their opinion about the
initiatives debated on a daily basis. The application aims to provide greater accessibility to such information which, despite
being open data and available to citizens, is sometimes difficult to consult.
